Package orderedset implements a dynamic, insertion-ordered, set abstract data
type. A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values.

The curent implementation:

  - Is a dynamic set.
    It implements actions to Add() or Remove() elements from it among others.
  - Is ordered.
    Instead the generic set, this implementation is insertion ordered,
    meaning that when iterating over its elements, it will return them in
	order they where inserted originally.

Example

	package main

	import (
		"github.com/goombaio/orderedset"
	)

	func main() {
		s := orderedset.NewOrderedSet()
		s.Add("First element")
		s.Add("Second element")
		s.Add("Last element")

		for _, entry := range s.Values() {
			fmt.Println(entry)
		}
		// Output:
		// First element
		// Second element
		// Last element
	}
